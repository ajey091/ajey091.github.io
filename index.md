Hey there! I'm Ajey, a data scientist with a flair for transforming complex data into actionable insights and innovations. After diving deep into aerospace engineering during my PhD at Purdue University, I found my true passion in the vast universe of data science. Now, I spend my days at Magnite in Los Angeles, where I tinker with AI to make online advertising smarter and more efficient. It's pretty rewarding, especially when our solutions boost ad revenue without sacrificing user happiness.

When I'm not optimizing ad placements or mentoring the next generation of data scientists, I'm probably knee-deep in my latest project, like using deep learning to dream up DJ names or analyzing Formula One races to figure out what makes a winner.

I love making complex concepts accessible and exciting, whether I'm collaborating with engineers and product teams or sharing insights on my blog. If you're into data-driven decision-making or just want to hear more about the magic of machine learning, you've come to the right place. Let's explore the data landscape together!
