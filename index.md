I'm Ajey, I'm currently a Lead Data Scientist for Ads at Philo, where I use data to solve business problems. My journey started during my PhD in Computational Sciences at Purdue. Before Philo, I worked as a Senior Data Scientist at Magnite where I developed machine learning solutions to optimize programmatic advertising outcomes.

I focus on using statistics and machine learning to tackle technical challenges. Through my blog and work with colleagues, I show how data science can address real business problems across industries. I care about delivering results that matter, whether that's increasing revenue or improving user experience. 

Team leadership has become a cornerstone of my professional identity. I find genuine satisfaction in building high-performing teams where diverse perspectives converge to create innovative solutions. The collaborative environment of data science provides constant opportunities to mentor others while learning from their unique approaches to problem-solving.

Outside of work, I stay active at the gym and train for running events. You'll also find me trying new restaurants, cooking, or at live music shows. These activities keep me balanced and energized.

If you're interested in data science or machine learning, let's connect. I'm always ready to share ideas and learn from others in this field.
