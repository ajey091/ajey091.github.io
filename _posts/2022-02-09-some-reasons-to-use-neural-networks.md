While the promise and popularity of neural networks is far more prevalent in popular media than in actual technical practice, it's useful to occasionally revisit some good reasons to use neural networks. In short, neural networks are versatile non-linear models that work well for many different types of problems. Reasons for using a deep neural network model (with more than 1 hidden layer) are primarily when our problem requires some non-obvious feature engineering - in image classification, it is unclear how to define the different layers to identify different components of an object.
