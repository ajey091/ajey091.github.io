## Introduction

This post details our methodology for fine-tuning language models to generate authentic child-directed speech for the Caregiver Robot system. Building upon our [previous work]({% post_url 2024-12-26-fine-tuning-language-models %}), we introduce a novel approach using age-stratified model training to capture how caregivers naturally adapt their speech patterns as children develop. By creating specialized models for different developmental stages, we enable precise study of the relationship between linguistic input and language acquisition.

A key challenge in child language acquisition research has been controlling for the natural variability in caregiver speech. This makes it difficult to isolate specific factors that drive language learning. Our artificial system addresses this by generating developmentally appropriate child-directed speech in a controlled way, opening new possibilities for systematic investigation of language acquisition mechanisms. The models can produce consistent linguistic input while varying targeted features, allowing for controlled experiments that would be impossible with human caregivers.

## Methodological Overview

The core of our approach involves fine-tuning Facebook's OPT-350M transformer model using carefully curated, age-stratified data derived from the Child Language Data Exchange System (CHILDES) corpus. We selected OPT-350M as our foundation model due to its optimal balance between computational efficiency and linguistic capability, providing sufficient model capacity to learn complex language patterns while remaining tractable for multiple parallel training runs.

Our approach involves training both age-specific models for distinct developmental ranges and a unified model trained on data across all age ranges. The age-specific models capture linguistic characteristics that caregivers use when interacting with children at particular developmental stages, while the unified model learns general patterns of child-directed speech adaptation over time. Such a strategy allows us to compare the effectiveness of specialized versus general approaches in modeling caregiver speech patterns.

### Age Stratification Strategy

We partitioned the data into three developmental periods based on established child language acquisition milestones:

- **Early Period (3-15 months)**: Pre-linguistic and early babbling stage
- **Middle Period (15-27 months)**: First words and early vocabulary explosion
- **Late Period (27-45 months)**: Grammar development and complex sentence formation

This stratification captures the natural progression of caregiver speech adaptation, from highly simplified, repetitive utterances to more complex linguistic structures.

## Data Preprocessing Pipeline

### Dataset Integration and Cleaning

Our preprocessing pipeline begins with comprehensive data integration from multiple CHILDES corpora:

```python
def clean_text(text):
    if not isinstance(text, str):
        return ""
    text = re.sub(r'xxx+|www+', '', text)  # Remove transcription artifacts
    text = re.sub(r'\b\d+\b', '', text)    # Remove isolated numbers
    text = re.sub(r'\s+', ' ', text)       # Normalize whitespace
    return text.strip()
```

The cleaning function addresses common transcription artifacts in CHILDES data, including standardized notation for unintelligible speech (xxx) and incomplete words (www). We preserve numerical content when it appears in meaningful linguistic contexts while removing isolated digits that typically represent transcription codes.

### Age Range Processing

A critical component of our methodology involves extracting meaningful age information from the heterogeneous age representations in CHILDES:

```python
def extract_min_age(age_range):
    if not isinstance(age_range, str): return None
    try:
        age_str = age_range.split('-')[0].strip()
        match = re.match(r'^\d+', age_str)
        return int(match.group(0)) if match else None
    except Exception: return None
```

This function handles various age format inconsistencies in the corpus, extracting the minimum age from range representations. We focus on the minimum age as it provides the most conservative estimate of the child's developmental stage.

## Model Architecture and Training Configuration

### Base Model Selection

We selected Facebook's OPT-350M as our foundation model for several reasons:

1. **Computational Efficiency**: The 350M parameter size provides a balance between model capacity and training feasibility
2. **Open Source Availability**: Full model weights and architecture details are publicly available
3. **Proven Performance**: Demonstrated effectiveness on language generation tasks

### Fine-Tuning Strategy Decision

Our initial approach involved Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning, which offers computational efficiency by updating only a small subset of model parameters. However, preliminary experiments with LoRA on child-directed speech data produced unsatisfactory results. Quantitative analysis revealed that the generated text had significantly different Type-Token Ratios (TTR), word frequency distributions, and Mean Length of Utterance (MLU) compared to the original CHILDES corpus, indicating that the model failed to capture the core linguistic patterns of child-directed speech.

Given these limitations, we pivoted to full fine-tuning, which updates all model parameters and provides greater capacity for learning domain-specific patterns. While computationally more expensive, full fine-tuning proved necessary to capture the complex linguistic adaptations present in child-directed speech. The choice of OPT-350M represented an optimal compromise: large enough to learn sophisticated linguistic patterns through full fine-tuning, yet small enough to remain computationally tractable for training multiple age-stratified models in parallel.

### Training Hyperparameters

Our training configuration prioritizes stability and generalization:

```python
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir=model_dir,
    per_device_train_batch_size=4,
    gradient_accumulation_steps=8,
    learning_rate=2e-5,
    max_steps=10000,
    logging_steps=50,
    save_steps=500,
    eval_steps=500,
    save_total_limit=2,
    load_best_model_at_end=True,
    metric_for_best_model="loss",
    greater_is_better=False,
    fp16=torch.cuda.is_available(),
    lr_scheduler_type="linear",
    warmup_steps=500,
    gradient_checkpointing=True,
)
```

The effective batch size of 32 (4 Ã— 8 gradient accumulation) provides stable gradient estimates while remaining within GPU memory constraints. The learning rate of 2e-5 follows established best practices for fine-tuning transformer models on domain-specific data.

## Stratified Training Approach

### Data Splitting Strategy

For each age group, we implement stratified sampling to ensure representative train/validation splits:

```python
if stratify_col in group_data.columns:
    value_counts = group_data[stratify_col].value_counts()
    if (value_counts < 2).any():
        stratify_values = None  # Disable stratification for small classes
    else:
        stratify_values = group_data[stratify_col]
```

This approach maintains speaker distribution across splits, preventing overfitting to particular caregiver speech patterns while ensuring sufficient diversity in both training and validation sets.

### Tokenization and Sequence Processing

Our tokenization strategy addresses the specific characteristics of child-directed speech:

```python
def tokenize_function(examples):
    texts = [str(text) + tokenizer.eos_token for text in examples["text"] 
             if isinstance(text, str)]
    tokenized_output = tokenizer(
        texts, 
        padding="max_length", 
        truncation=True, 
        max_length=256, 
        return_tensors="pt"
    )
    return tokenized_output
```

The 256-token maximum length accommodates the typically shorter utterances in CDS while preventing computational overhead from longer sequences. The explicit addition of end-of-sequence tokens ensures proper boundary detection during generation.

## Model Evaluation Framework

### Validation Strategy

Each age-stratified model undergoes continuous evaluation during training using held-out validation data from the same age group. This approach ensures that model performance metrics reflect age-appropriate language generation capabilities.

### Cross-Age Generalization

While our primary focus is age-specific performance, we also evaluate cross-age generalization by testing each model on validation data from other age groups. This analysis provides insights into the transferability of learned linguistic patterns across developmental stages.

## Technical Challenges and Solutions

### Memory Management

Training multiple models sequentially requires careful memory management:

```python
del model
del trainer
if torch.cuda.is_available():
    torch.cuda.empty_cache()
```

This cleanup procedure prevents GPU memory accumulation across training runs, ensuring consistent performance throughout the entire training pipeline.

### Data Quality Assurance

Our pipeline includes multiple validation steps to ensure data quality:

1. **Empty content filtering**: Removal of utterances with no meaningful content after cleaning
2. **Minimum data requirements**: Enforcement of minimum sample sizes for reliable model training
3. **Stratification validation**: Dynamic adjustment of splitting strategies based on data characteristics

## Results and Performance Metrics

### Training Convergence

All age-stratified models demonstrated stable convergence within the 10,000-step training limit. The linear learning rate schedule with warmup proved effective in preventing early overfitting while ensuring sufficient learning capacity.

### Age-Specific Adaptations

Preliminary analysis reveals distinct linguistic patterns across age groups:

- **Early models** generate shorter, more repetitive utterances with higher prosodic variation markers
- **Middle models** show increased vocabulary diversity while maintaining simplified grammatical structures
- **Late models** demonstrate more complex syntax patterns and conditional language use

## Future Directions

### Multi-Modal Integration

Future work will integrate these age-stratified language models with corresponding speech synthesis systems, creating a comprehensive age-adaptive caregiver robot capable of both appropriate content generation and prosodic adaptation.

### Longitudinal Validation

We plan to validate our age-stratified approach through longitudinal studies with our Child Learner Robot, measuring language acquisition outcomes across different caregiver model configurations.

## Conclusion

Our age-stratified fine-tuning methodology represents a significant advancement in creating developmentally appropriate artificial caregivers. By capturing the natural evolution of caregiver speech patterns across child development stages, we enable more precise experimental control in language acquisition research while maintaining ecological validity.

The complete training pipeline demonstrates the feasibility of creating specialized language models for child-directed speech generation, opening new possibilities for controlled studies of early language development and intervention strategies.
