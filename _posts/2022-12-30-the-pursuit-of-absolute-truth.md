I have been recently finding myself in conversations with people where less than ideal human behavior is constantly attributed to and justified by the fact that truth is subjective to the forces of culture, region and so on. I have personally been a strong proponent of the idea that what we (as a human race) are after is the absolute truth - a truth that supercedes all lower dimensional notions of subjectivity.
