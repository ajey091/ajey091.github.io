I am surprised to learn that a [quick fun post](https://ajeyvenkataraman.com/2019/09/07/word-cloud-of-song-lyrics/) in the last year has turned out to be the most popular post of my website. It is my attempt here to provide some code to generalize the approach followed in the previous post. Specifically, in the previous post, I only created a word cloud for song lyrics of a particular song. Here, I am extending that to include any song of user's choice. The extension is fairly straightforward. Following are the adopted steps:

- Make a call to a web API to a song lyrics website - here, we choose a free website called [Canarado Lyrics.](https://rapidapi.com/canarado/api/canarado-lyrics)
- We parse the input song and artist names, and obtain the lyrics.
- Further, we parse the lyrics text to make some formatting changes.
- Then we use the robust [Wordcloud](https://github.com/amueller/word_cloud)Â  package to create a wordcloud.

The code for the above steps is given below:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/ajey091/5a576b351d344dd0ec66e49c16925441.js"></script>

There are two ouputs - raw text of the lyrics (a snippet is shown below) and the wordcloud.

The above is just the most basic version of the wordcloud output. There are plenty of possible modifications that can be made to get creative with the output wordcloud - some examples given [here](https://github.com/amueller/word_cloud/tree/master/examples).
