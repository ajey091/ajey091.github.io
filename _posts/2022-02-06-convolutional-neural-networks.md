Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are a specialized type of neural networks for processing data with a grid-like topology. This essentially means time series data along a discretized grid or more commonly, images (which are RGB or grayscale pixels). CNNs have been practically useful for image classification tasks. In image classification tasks,
