Welcome to my website. My name is Ajey Venkataraman, I am a Data Scientist at Magnite. I am based in Los Angeles, CA; I like solving technical and business problems using computers.

If you see a flurry of recent posts, it's because I am currently in the process of porting from a wordpress site I have had for a while to this Github pages website.
